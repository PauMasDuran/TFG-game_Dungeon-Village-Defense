**Roguelike Demo: Dungeon Village Defence**

*Introduction*

This is a demo version of my roguelike game developed as part of my final thesis project for my degree in Multimedia Engineering at the UVIC-UCC (University of Vic - Central University of Catalonia). 
The game features of procedurally generated dungeons, dynamic comabat, and a variety of enemies that will become stronger the deeper you get into the dungeon.
